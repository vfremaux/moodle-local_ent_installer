Here come a set of common concepts for all models : 

#####################

## Contexts (ldap) :

Usually designates a location in the LDAP tree from where to start search for target directory entities.

## Selector filter:

Designates a LDAP filter that selects and reduce the available directory entities to consider.

## Attribute :

Usually designates a LDAP attribute of the targtted entity.

## Filter (attribute) :

Usually designates a Regex pattern extracting part of the attribute data as the useful payload.

## Pattern (attribute) :

Usually designates an injection pattern (glue with placeholders) to generate the final moodle side data value. This is applied
only to data that must be stored into moodle.

## Target (attribute) :

If present, may designate the moodle target field to feed, in case there can be
some ambiguity. Usually implicit in setting name.

## Mapping (attribute) :

If present, will proceed to a value input => output mapping in case the LDAP value encoding is not straight away usable
in moodle.

    1. Collect all required fields from settings.
    2. Get selected entities in contexts with filter
    3. foreach result :
        foreach attribute :
            case attribute : Get the attribute value as is with UTF-8 filtering
            case attribute + filter : Get the attribute value, apply regexp and get the first capturing subpattern
            case attribute + pattern : Get the attribute value and inject result in pattern
            case attribute + filter + pattern : Get the attribute value get the first capturing subpattern and inject it in pattern for the final value.
